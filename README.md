The code in this repository was used to support the findings of the study,
"Mutational landscape influences immunotherapy outcomes among non-small cell lung cancer
patients with human leukocyte antigen supertype B44." doi 10.1038/s43018-020-00140-1

There are 3 main scripts that enable replication of our work.
1. tcga_mut: uses vep amino acid notation to adjust dna base mutations for tcga data
2. amino_acid: creates heatmaps using vep amino acid notation
3. motif_neoepitopes: identifies motif neoepitopes based on output from Miao and colleagues Nat Genen 2018 paper.
